## What we will cover

* What is a service worker?
* Why are they so powerful?
* When do I use them and why?

## Notes

Service workers are in essence a way for you to cache
responses from a server.

Why is this so powerful?

It will let you load a webpage instantly once it
has been shown once without using a network.

Offline webpages baby!

A service worker will let you give your users a native
feel without a framework and if you play your cards right,
no loaders.

Service workers only work over https.

Why? Imagine a hacker adding a file to your browser that
let's them control what files you see whenever you visit
that website.
